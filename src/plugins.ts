/**
 * Rules that arrive from the repository instead of from this package.
 *
 * A linter is a registry. `allRules` is a hardcoded array in this package, which
 * makes the rule CONTRACT pluggable and the rule SET closed: writing an opinion
 * of your own means forking the tool. ESLint solved this and the shape is worth
 * copying -- a rule is a value, a plugin is a module that exports values, and the
 * config says which ones to run.
 *
 * A plugin module exports `rules`. Nothing else about it is special, so a plugin
 * is also how a PRESET ships: the opinions in this package could be published as
 * one, and a repository could enable it alongside its own.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - It does not swallow a plugin that fails to load. A rule that silently is not
 *   there is worse than one that errors, because the report looks clean.
 * - It does not skip fingerprinting. `policy.analysisVersion` was a hand-bumped
 *   string that got forgotten twice, and the same hole opens the moment a rule
 *   can live outside the directory this tool hashes: an edited plugin with an
 *   unchanged path would replay a stale report. Each plugin's own source is
 *   hashed into the run manifest for that reason.
