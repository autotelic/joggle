/**
 * What counts as source.
 *
 * This used to be TypeScript only, and it was never a decision: the extension
 * list arrived with the first rebuild and nobody revisited it. On one real
 * repository that meant 1,457 JavaScript files -- an entire API and an entire
 * admin UI -- were never read, while the report said "287 files" with no hint
 * that four fifths of the tree was missing. A partial analysis that looks
 * complete is the worst output this program can produce.
 *
 * Both discovery paths ask this -- the directory walk and the compiler's file
 * list -- so a run with paths and a run without cannot disagree about what is
 * source.
 *
 * Declarations stay out: a `.d.ts` describes a build's output rather than a
 * source file, and analysing one reports on code nobody wrote.
