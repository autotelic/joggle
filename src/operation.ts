 * errors are different, so agreement is evidence and disagreement is a signal --
 * the method the approximation book opens with, applied to the tool rather than
 * to a physics problem.
 *
 * The table is NOT a proof. It reads like one, and the first version of this file
 * presented it as one, which is the exact defect `joggle/rule-judgment` exists to
 * find: a person's opinion wearing the costume of a rule. So it is named for what
 * it is, it is cross-checked, and a disagreement is reported rather than hidden.
