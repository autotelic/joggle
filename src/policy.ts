 * The first version of this file held sixteen numbers that *decided* things:
 * probability floors, weights for a hand-rolled composite score, confidence
 * gates. That is the entropy machine's disease with an API bill -- a person's
 * guess wearing a number, unreviewable and impossible to argue with, and the
 * reason the earlier rules could only be improved by fiddling.
 *
 * Every decision now belongs to exactly one Effect Decision, and code reads its
 * answer. Numbers survive only where they bound *search*: how similar a pair
 * must be before it is worth a call, and how many calls a run may make. Those
 * are recall and cost knobs. Judging a candidate is the model's job; finding
 * candidates is the code's.

     * and it says exactly when that applies: "the document dominates every

     * document, the closer the saving gets to a full Nx."
     *
     * Our candidates are not one shared document. They are different clusters

     * the per-request boilerplate and nothing else. Measured on 80 identical

     *
     *   unbatched   80 calls   101,903 input tokens
     *   batched      5 calls    82,091 input tokens   (19%, not 12x)
     *   identical verdicts: 37/80 = 46%

     * And the disagreements were systematic rather than noisy: redundancy
     * scores fell by 0.05-0.10 across the board, and `member_0` started winning

     * bias, exactly what the primitives page warns about when it says to give
     * each question only the context it needs.

     * So batching is OFF by default and the speed comes from concurrency, which
     * is the other pattern the docs prescribe -- the re-ranking cookbook fires
     * 1,200 independent calls through a thread pool and calls it cheap. The
