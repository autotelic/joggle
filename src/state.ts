/**
 * Where joggle's state lives, and how it is read back.
 *
 * Three artifacts, three lifecycles:
 *
 *   <root>/.joggle/answers/     reviewed, committed, replayed by CI: sharded
 *   <root>/.joggle/baseline/    reviewed, committed: the ratchet, as fragments
 *   <machine cache>/joggle/<root>/   ephemeral, machine-local, never committed
 *
 * The first two belong to the repository, because they are decisions a person
 * should be able to read in a diff and because CI replays them with no API key.
 * Both are directories of small files -- one shard of answers, one fragment per
 * accepted finding -- so that two branches write different files rather than the
 * same one. The third is a performance artifact -- a manifest, the last report,
 * and the per-file facts -- and it belongs to the machine: it is the largest, it
 * churns on every edit, and writing it into a working tree means analysing
 * someone else's checkout leaves litter in it. `docs/artifacts.md` is the long
 * form.
 *
 * One machine cache serves every repository, keyed by the analysed root, so
 * pointing joggle at any number of checkouts costs no per-repo setup and writes
 * nothing into them.
