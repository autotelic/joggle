/**
 * Parsing, as a cached unit of work keyed by its inputs.
 *
 * The idea is from a talk about Turbopack's incremental engine (docs/turbo.md):
 * every expensive operation becomes a cached unit whose key is derived from what
 * it reads, because "I don't really trust developers to write correct cache keys
 * or track inputs by hand".
 *
 * The measurement that justifies it: on one repository the whole-run fingerprint
 * meant any change at all re-parsed 2,456 files, and `read+parse` was 2.3 of the
 * 2.4 seconds the workspace took. A one-line edit cost 2.3 seconds to answer a
 * question about one file.
 *
 * A parse reads exactly two things -- the text of the file and the parser -- so
 * the key is exactly those two. The text comes from the call site, which already
 * has it; the parser is the tool's own fingerprint, checked when the cache is
 * opened. There is no third thing a parse could depend on.
 *
 * WHAT IS STORED, AND WHAT IS NOT. Only the ANALYSIS: the units, their imports
 * and the file's structural facts. Not the file's text, which the caller already
 * has in memory; not a unit's text, which is a slice of it; not a unit's tokens,
 * which are a function of its shape; and not its shingles, which are a function
 * of its tokens. The first version stored all of it and produced a 67 megabyte
 * cache for 2,456 files -- most of it the same bytes said four different ways.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It is not a reactive graph. Turbopack tracks which cell
 * read which and propagates invalidation upward with early cutoff; this is one
 * layer of that idea, at the point where 96% of the time is. A dependency graph
 * over eight thousand units would cost more to maintain than it saves at this
 * size, and the talk is honest about the overheads -- memory, and "global
 * algorithms harm incrementality" -- that such a system brings with it.
