/**
 * The composition pattern, as an opinion rather than a default.
 *
 * These five rules came out of a starter repository's own documentation. They are
 * somebody's architecture -- a provider owning `{ state, actions, meta }`, blocks
 * exported by dot notation, one file per block -- and running them on a codebase
 * that never agreed to that is the entropy machine with a command-line flag.
 *
 * So they ship as a preset. A repository opts in:
 *
 *   { "presets": ["@autotelic/joggle/presets/composition"] }
 *
 * and gets the rules AND their severities. It can then override any of it per
 * rule, because a preset sets defaults rather than taking over.
 *
 * The four bundle checks are structural and free, so enabling this preset costs
 * no tokens. The page rule is the only judged one, and it triggers on evidence --
 * local state and inline markup -- rather than on a file being under `routes/`.
