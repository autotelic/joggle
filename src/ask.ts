/**
 * Semantic search over the declarations, in one request.

 * The pattern is TypeSafe's line-by-line search: put the query and the candidates
 * in the state, ask one Choice over the candidates so the whole probability
 * distribution is a ranking rather than a single winner, and ask one Noul for the
 * absolute question the Choice cannot answer -- does this codebase answer at all.
 * A Choice is relative (which of these) and a Noul is absolute (is there one), so
 * the two together separate "nothing here" from "the best of a bad set".
 *
 * The candidates are prefiltered in code by keyword overlap. That is not a
 * judgement, it is a state bound: the model reads worse as unrelated state grows,
 * so the query never sees the whole workspace.
