/**
 * The answer cache, as a sharded content-addressed store.
 *
 * One file per shard, one entry per line, and the shard is a function of the
 * key alone. The key (`answerKeyFor`) already content-addresses the decision,
 * the atoms it read, the model and the decision version, so two branches that
 * judge different candidates write different shards -- or, when they collide on
 * a shard, different lines. That is the whole design: a merge is a directory
 * merge, and the residual collision is a same-line one, which the shipped merge
 * driver (`joggle merge-answers`) resolves by key.
 *
 * The shape is Bazel's: sharded content-addressed storage, written
 * deterministically (lines sorted by key) so a diff is the change and not the
 * reordering, JSONL rather than pretty-printed JSON so the file is line-oriented
 * and can merge at all. The prior art and the reasoning are in
 * `docs/artifacts.md`.
 *
 * The single `answers.json` written before the shard split is still read, and
 * the first write migrates it: every shard is written, then the old file is
 * removed. A reader that never writes leaves it alone.
