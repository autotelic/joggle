// Meta-rules: the fence for rule authors.
//
// plumb ships rules that lint its own plugin authors (`require-create-once`,
// `require-rule-tester`, `no-manual-ancestor-walks`). joggle had none, which is
// why this session shipped a rule with no `violations`, an unbounded atom and an
// inline message before anyone noticed. These are the same idea: a small, named
// set of invariants every rule in this repository must keep, checkable from the
// source and enforced by a test.
//
// They are deliberately source-level. A rule's `plan` cannot be run without a
// workspace and a model, so the check reads what a rule declares rather than what
// it does -- the same trade plumb's meta-rules make over the plugin source.
