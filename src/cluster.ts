 * A group of declarations a rule believes are one thing, and therefore one

 * findings, and the "canonical" one was whichever sorted first by path, so the
 * report advised keeping `lookupUserById` over `findUserById` for no reason
 * other than the alphabet. Clusters make the actionable unit explicit: N copies,
 * one decision, one report -- and the choice of which to keep becomes something
 * the model decides rather than something `sort` decides.
 *
 * Clustering is only meaningful when the relation is transitive. Identical
 * shape and near-identical bodies are: if A is a copy of B and B of C, all three
 * are one thing. Names are not -- see naming-drift -- and that rule now judges
 * pairs instead.
