// `call-pattern` compares the WHOLE sequence. But when the shared run is the body
// of a helper that already exists, the longer function has inlined it and should
// call it instead. That is the case a whole-sequence comparison cannot see, and it
// is how a shared filter, validation or query chain gets copied into a second
// call site.
//
// What is deterministic is the run. Calls are resolved, so "the same call" is
// identity, and the run is extended left and right from a shared n-gram so the
// candidate names the longest one. Whether that run is a helper somebody inlined
// -- or a common idiom both functions happen to perform -- is the question.
