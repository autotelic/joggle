/**
 * Ask about many clusters and turn the answers into findings.
 *
 * One call per cluster, and the cache is the reason: the key is the state and the
 * questions, so a call that carried several clusters would lose every cluster's
 * verdict when one of them changed. Per-candidate calls keep a verdict keyed to
 * its own evidence.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT the speculative fan-out the TypeSafe docs measure at
 * 11.5x cheaper, and the difference is worth stating rather than copying the
 * pattern by name: fan-out amortises ONE state across many questions, while each
 * candidate here has its OWN state, so a batched call would send the same total
 * bytes and save only round trips. `ask.ts` is where fan-out belongs, and it is
 * used there -- one state, one decision per candidate.
 *
 * `requestConcurrency` overlaps the calls, and the decision layer serializes its
 * own cache writes.
