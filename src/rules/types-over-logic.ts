// A guard clause on a value whose type should carry the guarantee.
//
// The rule this repository kept needing: a problem is chased down by ADDING
// LOGIC -- another `if`, another check -- where refining a type (a brand, a
// refined schema, a non-nullable type parsed once) would make the check
// unnecessary and the class of bug impossible. `parse, don't validate` as a
// finding rather than a principle.
//
// Two facts, and neither classifies:
//
//   the guard    an AST `if` whose branch returns or throws, and the references
//                its test names (`file.facts.guards`)
//   the type     the CHECKER's resolved type for that reference, from the trace
//
// An earlier version matched `if (!x)` and `x === null` against the source and
// kept a hand-written set of "wide" type names. That decided the question Jev is
// for, and it is coupled to how this repository spells a guard
// (`docs/rule-coupling.md`). The shape is syntax, the type is the checker's, and
// what it MEANS is asked.
//
// It needs the trace: without one there is no type to ask about, and the rule
// says so rather than guessing from the text. `joggle check --types`.
