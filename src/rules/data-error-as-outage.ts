// A 5xx for a row that is not there.
//
// The amplifier the nullability work cannot see. A missing row is a normal
// outcome -- somebody deleted it, or the id is wrong -- and answering "the server
// is broken" turns one bad request into an outage signal: pagers, error budgets,
// retries against a request that will never succeed.
//
// THE CANDIDATE IS HIGH RECALL, AND IT DOES NOT DECIDE WHAT A ROW READ IS.
//
// An earlier version of this rule decided "does this branch read a row?" in code,
// by the callee's name: `find*`, `get*`, `load*`, and `parse*`. That was the
// classifier's work done ahead of time. Against a real repository it missed a
// read named inside a callback, a bare call, and a read whose verb was not on the
// list -- three false negatives a reviewer had to find by hand, because a
// candidate that is never sent cannot be recovered by any answer. So the code now
// finds the SHAPE that could be about a row (a nullish guard, or a catch, that
// answers a 5xx) and asks the model the question the names were guessing at.
//
// Two questions, atomic, answered against the same state:
//   about_a_row  is the branch about a row in a data store?   (Noul)
//   verdict      is the absent row normal, or a broken invariant? (Choice)
// Code composes them: report only when the branch IS about a row and the absence
// is normal. The names are gone; the state carries the answer.
