 * A JSDoc that makes a claim the implementation contradicts.

 * Three comments in three merged PRs on one repository were the same defect: a
 * doc block that had drifted from the code it sat on.
 *
 *   "comment says 'null for people with no project role' but band is typed as
 *    ReportingBand (not nullable)"
 *   "This points at a compareYears note that does not exist."
 *   "JSDoc says title-cased but there is no capitalization in here"
 *
 * None is a type error and none is a lint error. The type checker reads the type,
 * not the prose, and a linter reads syntax. The doc is the one artefact with no
 * checker at all, which is why it is the one that drifts.
 *
 * The model is the right instrument because the question is about meaning: does
 * the sentence describe what the code does? The prompt is strict on purpose --
 * a concrete contradiction only -- so the rule reports drift rather than style.
