/**
 * A function that calls one half of a paired operation without the other.
 *
 * The CANDIDATE is structural and exact: a function that calls `lock` and not
 * `unlock`, matched by the resolved call names inside its own span. That is a
 * fact, and code computes it for free.
 *
 * Whether it is a problem is not a fact. `lock` may acquire a mutex, or it may
 * be the name of something that is not a lock; the release may be the caller's
 * job; the two names may share a stem and mean two different things. The old Rust
 * tool answered that with a threshold and reported every match. The answer is a
 * judgement, so the model makes it.
 *
 * The pairs are deliberately few. `start` and `stop` are not here: a function
 * called `startTimer` calls `start`, and the `stop` lives elsewhere by design.
