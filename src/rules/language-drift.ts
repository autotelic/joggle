 * A domain word the prose uses and the code does not.

 *
 * The JUDGEMENT is whether the word names a domain concept the code calls
 * something else. A stopword list cannot answer it -- the first version reported
 * "whether", "what" and "every", and no list makes a heuristic correct. So the
 * model picks the concept, or says none, and code reports what it picked.
 *
 * The words are the Choice's options, one per candidate, so the answer names
 * which one is a concept rather than only that one exists.
