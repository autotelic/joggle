/**
 * Dependencies point one way, where the roles say the way is.
 *
 * `layer-direction` does this against layers a repository DECLARES, and it is
 * precise and free when they are written down. It has two problems that are not
 * about precision. Its globs go stale silently -- eight modules fell out of
 * joggle's own layering in one afternoon, and the rule reported zero upward
 * imports over the twenty-eight files it still covered. And a repository with no
 * config gets no direction check at all, which is two of the four repositories
 * this has been run against.
 *
 * This is the same check with the order INFERRED. It cannot come from the import
 * graph, because a topological order of the edges respects every edge by
 * construction, so a layering derived from the graph can never be violated by it.
 * It comes from what the roles mean instead: utilities and infrastructure sit
 * below the domain, which sits below the transport and rendering edges. That is a
 * fact about the words rather than a fact about this repository, so it needs no
 * declaration and cannot go stale.
 *
 * When layers ARE declared this rule stays out of the way and says so. A written
 * layering is more precise than a guessed one, and two rules reporting the same
 * upward import is how a report doubles without informing.
 *
 * The rank arithmetic is the CANDIDATE, not the verdict. An edge whose target
 * ranks above its source is worth asking about; whether it is a real upward
 * dependency, or the inferred order is what is wrong, is the question -- the same
 * question `layer-direction` asks, for the same reason. `rule-judgment` caught
 * this rule asserting the verdict from the arithmetic, which is the tool's own
 * rule applied to itself.
