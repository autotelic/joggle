// A shared path that discards items and does not say so.
//
// The review case: `adaptRows` skipped rows missing a person or a date for every
// caller, but only one of four endpoints surfaced `excluded`, so three silently
// returned totals that were short. The repository names this the "fallback data"
// anti-pattern in AGENTS.md, and it is joggle's own funnel principle turned on the
// code: every bound this program hits is reported, and a path that shortens its
// input without saying so produces a number that is wrong in a way nobody can see.
//
// Two facts, and neither classifies:
//
//   the skip     a `continue`, from the AST: the loop moved on without an item
//   the boundary an EXPORTED function -- a path whose result other files read
//
// An earlier version matched adapter NAMES (`adapt`, `normalize`, a path under
// `adapters/`) and looked for the word "excluded" in the body. That decided the
// question -- is this a boundary, does it account? -- in code, coupled to one
// repository's naming (docs/rule-coupling.md). The skip is syntax, the boundary is
// the export, and whether the drop needs accounting is asked.
//
// A third fact narrows the candidates, when the type layer ran: what the function
// HANDS BACK. A path that returns a flag or nothing does not shorten the data its
// caller reads, whatever `continue` it contains. The list of non-data returns is a
// declared convention in policy, not a vocabulary in this rule.
