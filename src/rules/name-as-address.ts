/**
 * A name too common to be an address.
 *
 * The reference material this rule comes from opens with the measurement that
 * motivates it: an agent finds code by searching for a name, so `grep create`
 * returning 1,585 hits is not a style problem, it is a retrieval problem.
 *
 * The CANDIDATE is structural and free: an exported single-word name, called from
 * at least `minFiles` files, where the call RESOLVES to this declaration. The
 * resolution matters -- thirty call sites named `parse` reaching three different
 * functions are not sixty hits on any one of them -- and the single word matters,
 * because `fetchPayrollProjections` used in thirty files is a good address used
 * often.
 *
 * The JUDGEMENT is whether THIS word at THAT count fails as an address. The count
 * is a fact; the verdict is not. `range` reached from thirty files is a bad
 * address, while a one-word domain term reached from the same number may be the
 * right one. The first version answered with the threshold and asserted the
 * verdict in the message -- "searching for it finds everything and nothing" --
 * which moved a judgement into code. The model answers now, and code reports what
 * it picked.
