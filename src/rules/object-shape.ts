// What is deterministic is the state. A repeated key set is a fact: object
// literals are collected per file, the key sets are sorted (because `{a, b}` and
// `{b, a}` are one shape), and a shape shared by two or more files is a
// candidate. Whether that shape is ONE CONCEPT that deserves a name, or two
// concepts that happen to share field names, is not a fact. That is the question,
