// One field name declared with two incompatible types.
//
// A field name is a promise about meaning. When `projectId` is a `string` in one
// declaration and a `number` in another, code that moves between them compiles
// against whichever it imported and fails against the other.
//
// What is deterministic is the detection. Field types are compared after the
// index's own resolution (indexed access, local alias, union), a nullability
// difference counts, raw mirrors are skipped, and only declarations that can
// reach each other are related. What is a JUDGEMENT is what the disagreement
// means: one concept declared twice, two concepts sharing a name, or a deliberate
// difference that breaks nothing.
//
// That judgement is the one this rule used to make for the reader, and it is the
// reason the migration is cautious: an earlier experiment asking a concept
// question here produced MORE findings, not fewer (the model answered "one
// concept" about 85% of the time), so the question is worded to let it decline
// (`compatible`) and a non-decisive answer is flagged rather than printed. See
// `docs/type-resolution.md`.
