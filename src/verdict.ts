 * into a single probability the band, the gate and the report all read.
 *
 * A Choice is RELATIVE: its probabilities are a distribution over the labels, so

 * numbers (the jaggedness doc is explicit that P(noul) + P(not noul) need not be
 * 1), which is why the reduction is declared per question rather than assumed.
