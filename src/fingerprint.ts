/**
 * A hash of the tool's own source, which is the version nobody has to remember.
 *
 * `policy.analysisVersion` is a hand-bumped string, and a hand-bumped string is a
 * promise to remember. Forgetting it means the next run replays a report produced
 * by rules that no longer exist -- which happened twice in one session, and both
 * times the output looked entirely plausible, because a stale report is not
 * malformed, it is just wrong.
 *
 * So the version is no longer maintained by hand. The tool hashes its own sources
 * and puts that hash in the run manifest, and a change to a rule, a threshold or a
 * question cannot be missed because it cannot be omitted. `analysisVersion`
 * survives as the fallback for when the sources cannot be read, and as the
 * deliberate override for when a change is meant NOT to invalidate a run -- a
 * refactor, say, that provably cannot alter output.
 *
 * The cost is one pass over the tool's own source per run, which is a couple of
 * dozen small files, and it is paid once per run rather than once per file.
