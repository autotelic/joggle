/**
 * The surface a rule author writes against.
 *
 * A linter is a registry, and a registry is only half a plugin system. The other
 * half is this file: one entry point exporting everything a rule needs, so an
 * opinion of your own is a module that imports `@autotelic/joggle/plugin` rather than three
 * relative paths into a package's internals.
 *
 * That distinction is not cosmetic. `../../../src/rule.ts` is a path a rule
 * author has to guess and a maintainer is free to move; `@autotelic/joggle/plugin` is a
 * promise. Everything re-exported here is supported, and anything not here is
 * not -- which is also how a rule author knows what they are allowed to rely on.
 *
 * The split follows what a rule actually does:
 *
 *   write one          defineRule, finding, outcome, the Rule interface
 *   read the code      Workspace, Unit, ImportGraph, SourceFile, Cluster
 *   ask a question     Decision, DecisionModel, the answer readers
 *   decide in code     qualityOf, marginOfAnswer, declined, the gate vocabulary
 *   know the shape     policy, the layer and composition helpers
 *
 * A deterministic rule needs only the first two, and that is deliberate: most
 * opinions are free, and the API should make the free path the easy one.
