/**
 * The plumb opinions that apply to THIS repository.
 *
 * plumb asks whether one file is well formed; joggle asks whether two things are
 * the same and whether a thing fits here. This file is the first half running on
 * the second half's source, which is the honest test of both: the rules that need
 * one file to answer should be answerable here, and anything that needs two files
 * belongs to joggle.
 *
 * The ruleset is generic plus effect. joggle is a Node application built on
 * Effect -- gen, Schema, Layer, Ref, Context.Service -- and renders nothing, so
 * plumb-react stays out. plumb-meta is for people writing oxlint rules, which
 * joggle does not.
 *
 * `plumb-effect` is consumer-opt-in upstream because plumb itself is not an
 * Effect application. This repository is, so the whole set is on.
 *
 * The second Effect rulebook is `@effect/tsgo`'s, which is the Effect language
 * service's own diagnostics exposed as type-aware Oxlint rules. Every rule it
 * ships is enabled below, from all four of its categories, so the codebase is
 * held to the upstream opinion as well as plumb's. Correctness and anti-pattern
 * rules are errors; the Effect-native and style rules are warnings, matching the
 * tool's own taxonomy. `pnpm lint:update` folds the existing findings into the
 * same baseline ratchet, which is what makes adopting a rulebook this size
 * possible at all.
