# joggle

> Cross-file patterns and idioms for TypeScript, enforced like a linter.

`tsc` checks one program. `oxlint` checks one file. Neither can tell you that
two functions in different modules are the same concept, that a name means
something different here than it does there, or that a module is not shaped
like the other twelve modules of its kind.

joggle is the layer above both. It indexes the codebase into facts, generates
candidates cheaply and deterministically, and then asks narrow typed questions
about the candidates it cannot decide by looking. Answers come back as
probabilities, code keeps control of the thresholds, and the output is an
ordinary diagnostic -- so the same tool serves an editor, a pre-commit hook and
CI.

The design rule is one sentence: **be deterministic where you can prove, and
judge only where you must.**

## Where it sits

| Tool | Unit | Question | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tsc` / `tsgo` | the program | is this well-typed? | diagnostics |
| `oxlint` | the file and its AST | is this well-formed? | diagnostics |
| **joggle** | the codebase and its facts | is this the same thing as that? | diagnostics |

Because the output shape is identical, a host does not have to care which kind
of rule produced a finding. There is no separate report, no separate format,
and no separate gate.

## The shape of a rule

Every rule is a file with the same five moves.

```
find        deterministic, high recall, noise tolerated
  |
  v
evidence    the panel a reviewer would need in order to decide
  |
  v
questions   atomic, typed (Noul / Choice), all sent in one request
  |
  v
policy      weights and thresholds, imported from policy.ts
  |
  v
diagnose    span, message, help, confidence
```

Deterministic rules never call the judge. That is the only difference between
them and the judged ones.

## Running it

```sh
pnpm install

pnpm joggle rules                              # what is enforced
pnpm joggle check src                          # analyse a directory
pnpm joggle check --typecheck                  # carry tsgo diagnostics too
pnpm joggle check --format github              # GitHub Actions annotations
pnpm joggle check --offline                    # replay from cache, no network
pnpm joggle check --rule joggle/naming-drift   # one rule
pnpm joggle check --max-warnings 0             # warnings fail the build
pnpm joggle check --since origin/main          # only what this branch changed
pnpm joggle check --pr                         # only what this branch's PR changed
pnpm joggle check --pr-number 123              # only what PR 123 changed
```

With no paths, joggle asks `tsgo --listFilesOnly` what the project is, so it
analyses exactly what the compiler sees rather than whatever is on disk. With
paths, it walks them itself.

### Installing the command

The simplest way to use joggle from another workspace is to put it on `PATH`
once:

```sh
cd path/to/joggle && pnpm install && pnpm build
ln -sf "$PWD/scripts/joggle.sh" ~/.local/bin/joggle
```

Then, from any checkout:

```sh
joggle check --since origin/main
```

The wrapper resolves its own checkout through the symlink and runs the build
(falling back to the source). It looks for the TypeSafe key in three places, in
order: the environment, a gitignored `.env.local` beside the wrapper, and
doppler. The doppler fetch runs from the joggle root, because doppler resolves a
project from the **working directory's** `doppler.yaml` and a sibling
repository's setup wins over explicit `--project`/`--config` (and over
`DOPPLER_PROJECT` / `DOPPLER_CONFIG`); it also restores `HOME` from the passwd
database, because a host such as pi can spawn the command with no `HOME` and
doppler needs it to find its own auth. `JOGGLE_DOPPLER_PROJECT` and
`JOGGLE_DOPPLER_CONFIG` override the defaults `joggle` and `dev`. Commands that
need no key (`rules`, help, `--offline`) skip the lookup entirely, and a key
that cannot be found degrades to unverified findings -- with a warning on
stderr, which the pi tools surface in their result -- rather than taking the
tool down.

### From another repository

joggle runs its source in development, and its build when installed. Build once,
then link it into the repository you are working in:

```sh
cd path/to/joggle && pnpm install && pnpm build

cd path/to/other-repo
pnpm add -D file:/absolute/path/to/joggle   # or: pnpm link /absolute/path/to/joggle

pnpm exec joggle check --pr                 # after cutting a PR
```

`file:` installs a copy of `dist/`, so nothing in the other repository has to
understand TypeScript. `pnpm link` symlinks the source, which works because the
symlink's real path sits outside `node_modules` -- but a `file:` install needs
`dist/`, and `pnpm build` is what makes it.

### Inspecting a checkout you do not want to touch

A repository is only modified if it is being onboarded. To analyse a sibling
checkout without writing anything into it:

```sh
pnpm joggle:elsewhere ../shakti-v2 --since origin/develop --offline
```

`scripts/joggle-elsewhere.sh` runs `check --cwd <path>` and sends the answer
cache to the machine cache **unless the target already has a committed
`.joggle/`**, in which case the repository's own cache is used so a replay still
works. Nothing else is written: the run cache, the parse cache and any type
trace already live under the machine cache, and the default run makes no network
call when there is no key.

### As a pi extension

The repository is also a [pi](https://pi.dev) package. Install it once and pi
gains two tools and a command in every repository it works in:

```sh
pi install /absolute/path/to/joggle    # or: pi -e /absolute/path/to/joggle
```

| Name | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `joggle_check` | Run a scoped check and return the findings. Defaults to the changed scope, so it answers what the current batch of work introduced; `scope: "pr"` answers what a pull request introduced. |
| `joggle_rules` | List the rules a repository enforces. |
| `/joggle` | Run a check from the prompt line; arguments pass through, e.g. `/joggle --pr`. |

Both tools take a `cwd`, so a session in one repository can check a sibling:

```
joggle_check { cwd: "../shakti-v2", scope: "since", since: "origin/develop" }
```

`joggle_check` follows the same non-invasive cache rule as the script above: it
passes `--cache-dir` to the machine cache when the target has no `.joggle/`, and
uses the committed cache when it does. Pass an explicit `cacheDir` to override.
The extension is a shell over the CLI in this checkout (`dist/main.js`, falling
back to `src/main.ts`), and `JOGGLE_BIN` points it at a different build or a
wrapper.

Output formats follow oxlint, because oxlint already decided what a linter's
output should be and its decisions are worth copying:

| Format | Shape | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` (default) | `path:line:col: severity rule: message help: ...`, one line per problem | terminals and CI logs |
| `stylish` | grouped per file, aligned columns, colour on a TTY | reading by hand |
| `unix` | `path:line:col: message [Severity/rule]` plus a count | editors and scripts |
| `json` | everything, including per-answer confidence | another tool |
| `github` | Actions workflow commands | annotations |

A hand-rolled code frame was removed in favour of the compact default. On a
1,870-file codebase the frames made the report 8,083 lines; oxlint's shape
prints 343. A linter's output is read on a terminal and scrolled in CI, and
those two want different things.

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--rule <ids>` | comma-separated rule ids |
| `--format text\|stylish\|unix\|json\|github` | output format (see below) |
| `--max-warnings <n>` | fail when warnings exceed `n` (`-1` disables) |
| `--typecheck` | include tsgo diagnostics as `joggle/typecheck` |
| `--no-tsgo` | never invoke tsgo |
| `--offline` | answer only from the judgement cache |
| `--changed` | scope to what changed since the stored run |
| `--since <rev>` | scope to what changed since a git revision, working tree included |
| `--pr` | scope to the pull request for the current branch (resolved with `gh`) |
| `--pr-number <n\|url>` | scope to a specific pull request |
| `--cache-dir <path>` | where `answers.json` lives (default `.joggle`) |
| `--cwd <path>` | project root |

## CI and replay

A judgement is a network call, so the cache key is the contract:

```
question version + model + evidence + questions
```

It is serialised with sorted keys, so the same candidate produces the same key
on every machine — which means **run from the repository root**. Evidence
carries root-relative paths; running from a subdirectory changes the key and
misses every cached verdict. Successful judgements are written to
`.joggle/answers.json`; commit that file and CI replays them with
`--offline` and **no API key at all**. Bump `policy.decisionVersion` when you
change a question's wording, and every cached answer for it is invalidated at
once instead of silently replayed against newer questions.

When the judge is unavailable, judged rules are reported as skipped and the
deterministic rules still run. A missing key degrades the gate; it does not
disable it.

### Where the key goes

The key is read from the process environment only, so it never appears in the
repository or in any config file joggle owns.

Locally, use the secret manager the team already has:

```sh
doppler run -- pnpm joggle check src      # recommended
direnv allow                              # or a gitignored .envrc.local
```

In CI, add `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` as a repository secret and map it onto the step
that judges new candidates. The replay job needs no secret at all.

Two properties make this safe to live with:

* `.joggle/judgements.json` holds questions, evidence and answers. It never
  holds the key, so it is safe to commit and review.
* Because the cache is the replay path, **the judged run can be done by a
  person and the result handed to CI or to an agent**. Neither of them ever
  needs the credential; they work from the committed verdicts.

If the key is ever pasted into a file, into chat, or into a shell that gets
logged, rotate it in the TypeSafe console. This repository is private, so
GitHub's secret scanning will not catch it for you.

### What leaves the machine

The judged rules send the evidence panel -- including source excerpts of the
declarations being compared -- to `api.typesafe.ai`. Deterministic rules and
`--offline` send nothing.

Decide this per repository. For a client codebase, either point
`TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` at a deployment you control, or run the judged pass over
public and fixture code only and let the committed replay cache carry the
verdicts into the client's CI.

```sh
TYPESAFE_BASE_URL=https://typesafe.internal.example doppler run -- pnpm joggle check src
```

## The judgement

The evidence panel is the System One `state`; the questions are the typed
primitives. Everything the model returns is constrained to the options the rule
supplied, so nothing has to be recovered from generated prose.

- `Noul` -- the probability that a yes/no statement holds.
- `Choice` -- one option out of a set, with the full distribution and a
  confidence.

Thresholds live in `src/policy.ts` and nowhere else. When a verdict stops
matching what the team would decide, you change a weight, re-run, and see the
difference -- you do not rewrite a prompt.

### What the judge is actually for

Code finds; the model verifies. This is the opposite of how joggle started, and
the first real measurements are what corrected it.

Findings were being produced two ways: exact shape equality (a fact, but
reported unverified) and a hand-tuned near-duplicate search that asked the model
to *discover*. Over 55 API calls that produced 5 findings, and the questions
could not have done better, because two of the four were constants:

* `same_behavior` was asked about pairs selected *because their text differs*.
  Of 49 real judgements, 40 came back below 0.25. The answer was decided by the
  candidate filter before the question was asked.
* `merge_changes_behavior` -- "would replacing one with the other change
  behaviour for some caller?" -- was made a hard veto at 0.4. Across 49
  judgements it never once fell below 0.4 (mean 0.64). Asked without any call
  sites in the state, the model always answers "probably yes". A question whose
  answer is fixed in advance is not a judgement.

Both are gone. Behaviour is now asked about only where it is genuinely open,
and only in the band where the text actually differs.

The judge's job is intent, not behaviour. When two declarations are
syntactically identical, equivalence is already an AST fact; the only open
question is whether the repetition is redundancy or two things that merely look
alike. That is a perceptual question about names and purpose, which is what a
calibrated model is good at, and code decides what to do with the answer.

One policy rule has since been deleted for the same reason. It suppressed a
finding when the two declarations sat in different areas and neither was a
general-purpose utility. Over 500 verdicts that removed 284 candidates --
including a type named `GhostProjectSummary` declared once in the API and once
in the UI, where the model itself answered `sameName 0.97` and "keep left". The
gate inverted a correct judgement. **Locality is not intent**, and
`docs/names.md` is the argument: one concept should have one name and one
declaration. The model may now override the deterministic fact only when it
judges the two names to mean different things, or says confidently that both
should stay.

Below the judgement budget, candidates are still reported, marked unverified. A
budget must never silently delete a finding.

## Adding a rule

1. Add a `src/rules/<name>.ts` with the five moves above.
2. Register it in `src/rules/index.ts`.
3. Put every new threshold in `src/policy.ts`.
4. Test it twice: once with answers that should activate the policy, once with
   answers that should not.
5. Run `pnpm joggle check src` -- joggle is expected to pass its own rules.

## Why the next layer is types, not more AST

joggle reasons about syntax today: it parses with oxc, normalises a
declaration's text, and hashes it. That catches copy-pasted code -- on a
1,870-file codebase it found a `delay` helper copied into six files and one
type declared in 48 -- but 79% of what it reported were *type* declarations,
judged by text similarity. That is the wrong instrument, and the material in
`docs/` says why:

* `docs/names.md` -- types are the one contract the compiler enforces, and a
  type name is a search term exactly like a function name. Every `any` leaves
  the compiler with nothing to say and the agent with nothing to search.
* `docs/parse.md` -- the entire argument is that the type system is where a
  program makes illegal states unrepresentable, and that validation which
  discards what it learned is the anti-pattern.
* `docs/something.md` -- the goal is a compiler on top of the codebase that can
  refuse a change because "this file is in the wrong relationship to that".
* `docs/new-passes.md` names four pillars: AST structure, dependency graph,
  **type resolution data**, and text analysis. joggle has the first, part of
  the second, and none of the third.

Types are also the only layer where the answer is *provable* rather than
similar. Measured on that same codebase with `tsgo --generateTrace` -- 11.5s
and 301MB of type facts for 1,870 files:

```
User: 46 resolved entries across 24 declaring files, 3 distinct resolved shapes
      Object (x38), Any (x4), TypeParameter (x4)
```

One name, three meanings, four of them `any`. Text hashing cannot see that. The
checker knows it exactly.

So the direction is: keep the AST as the index and the source of spans, and
move the *judgements* to the type graph.

The first type-aware rule should be **`joggle/one-concept-one-type`**: the same
declared name resolving to different types in different places. Divergence is a
correctness problem; provable identity is a collapse candidate. Neither is
reachable from text.

Two implementation notes, because a trace is a hack that works and not the
final shape:

* `--generateTrace` needs no fork and is read-only, but the join from a source
  declaration to its resolved type is not a plain name lookup -- aliases expand,
  and one name can appear as several entries. `CompanyType` did not appear at
  all under its own name. Solving that join is the first task.
* The eventual host is the checker itself, the way `Effect-TS/language-service`
  and `effect-ts/tsgo` do it: run inside the compiler and ask
  `getTypeAtLocation`. The trace route buys the same facts today without
  maintaining a fork.

Deliberately *not* next: widening AST coverage to class and object-literal
methods. That is more surface on a weaker signal. It comes after types.


## Two committed artifacts, two machine artifacts

joggle's state is four files with four lifetimes. Two belong to the repository
and two belong to the machine.

| artifact | lives in | committed | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `answers.json` | `<root>/.joggle/` | **yes** | one answer per decision, keyed by the decision and the state it read. **This is the replay path**: CI replays it with no API key and no tokens. |
| `baseline.json` | `<root>/.joggle/` | **yes** | the findings already accepted: the ratchet. |
| `wire.json` | `<machine cache>/joggle/<root>/` | no | every wire request's response, keyed by the request. A performance artifact, and far too large to commit: 11.5 megabytes on a 2,493-file repository. |
| `last-run.json` | `<machine cache>/joggle/<root>/` | no | a manifest and the last report. A performance artifact. |

The first two are decisions a person should be able to read in a diff, and they
are per-repository because the evidence is keyed on root-relative paths. The
others are the largest, churn on every edit, and are worthless to anyone else — so
it lives in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` (or `~/Library/Caches` on macOS), keyed by the
analysed root. One machine cache serves every repository, and pointing joggle at
somebody else's checkout writes nothing into it.

### Running against a diff

```sh
joggle check --update-baseline          # on main: record what is accepted
joggle check --baseline .joggle/baseline.json   # on a branch: only what is new
joggle check                            # nothing changed: the previous run
```

The baseline is by identity, not by line: rule, kept symbol and cluster
membership. Code moves constantly, and a baseline that reports every edit as a
new finding is a baseline nobody reads. A rename or a new member does change the
identity, which is correct — the finding is a different finding then.

### Why an unchanged run costs nothing

`last-run.json` carries a manifest: a hash of `policy.analysisVersion`, the
question version, the model, the rule set, the analysed root, and the content of
every file. If it matches, the run ends after reading the files and before
parsing them. On a 1,870-file codebase:

```
cold, judgements cached    0 calls, 0 tokens, 3,718ms
again                      0 calls, 0 tokens,   325ms   (replayed)
```

The 325ms is file reads and hashing, which is what makes the check honest: it is
content, not mtimes. Add one file that duplicates nothing and the run is a full
analysis with zero calls; add the second copy and a new cluster exists, so
exactly that candidate is judged:

```
first copy of a new duplicate   0 calls,   0 tokens
second copy                     1 call,  846 tokens
nothing changed                 0 calls,   0 tokens, replayed
```

**`policy.analysisVersion` is the one thing that must be kept honest by hand.**
A candidate filter or a clustering rule can change every finding while leaving
every question byte-identical, and the manifest is what decides whether a stale
report gets replayed. Bump it when the rules move.


### Answering "what did this change introduce?"

Two scopes answer this. `--changed` compares against the last stored run, which
is machine-local and only exists once the repository has been analysed before:

```sh
joggle check --changed     # scope candidate generation to the changed declarations
```

`--since` and `--pr` answer the same question from git, so a fresh clone is
scoped on its first run. They include the working tree and untracked files, which
is what makes a second pass see the edit made after the first:

```sh
joggle check --since origin/main   # this branch against where it forked
joggle check --pr                  # the current branch's pull request
joggle check --pr-number 123       # a specific pull request
```

Both are sound because a change elsewhere cannot create a duplicate between two
declarations it did not touch: every *new* finding has at least one changed
member. Dependents come into scope only when a file's **exports** moved, because
only then can their type names resolve to something else — a refinement the
stored-run scope makes and the git scope does not.

What neither does is report removals, and neither is a full report — so a scoped
run leaves the stored run alone rather than becoming the next comparison base,
and a git scope never replays the stored full report.

Measured on 1,870 files:

| | calls | tokens | wall clock |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| nothing changed | 0 | 0 | **488ms** (replayed) |
| body edit to a widely-imported file | 0 | 0 | 4,737ms |
| comment inside a duplicated declaration | 1 | 1,571 | 5,284ms |
| same edit seen again | 0 | 0 | ~0 (cached verdict) |
| a full analysis | 0 | 0 | ~15s |

The 4.7s is file reads and hashing — correctness needs content, not mtimes. What
remains after that is parsing every file; an incremental fact cache keyed on
content hash would remove it. The candidate generation is already scoped.

## Not here yet

The honest list: **no type awareness** (see above -- it is the next layer), no
LSP, no `--fix`, no emission as an oxlint rule, and no
calibration harness. The calibration harness is the piece that has to exist
before any judged rule can move from `warn` to `error`.

`docs/` and `entropy-machine/` are untouched. `docs/` is the thinking that
motivated this layer -- how agents navigate code, why names are addresses, parse
don't validate, incremental computation, the deterministic harness.
`entropy-machine/` is the previous implementation: a Rust CLI of hand-written
heuristics. It stays as a reference for what these rules are trying to capture,
and as a reminder of why they are being written differently.
