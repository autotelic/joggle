# Two regimes

This is the question behind a round of work that added three static rules
(`reimplemented-primitive`, `field-type-drift`, `object-shape`), three judged
ones (`naming-drift`, `language-drift`, `one-concept-one-type`), and a type
layer. Going granular is only right in one of two regimes, and the line between
them is not "AST versus model". It is **what kind of decision the code is
making**.

## Regime 1: the code decides, and the classifier is a proxy for it

A table of thresholds and branches standing in for a classification that a
System One model would make better. The tell is a hand-written cut: a
`minWords`, a `minKeys`, a `>= 2`, a `switch` on a string that names a meaning.
Each one is a person's opinion wearing the costume of a fact -- exactly what
`joggle/rule-judgment` exists to find -- and each is a candidate to delete.

The concrete count today:

| Proxy | Cut | Would become |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `roleRank` in `roles.ts` | six roles hand-ranked `0..3`, so "which layer may import which" | a `Question` over a module and its role -- the ordering is a taste, not a derivation |
| `prescriptionFor` in `cluster-verdict.ts` | a table over `(role, relationship)` | one more `Decision.classify` whose options ARE the prescriptions |
| `field-type-drift` | `minWords >= 2` and `canCompose` string rules | "do these two declarations describe the same thing?" |
| `reimplemented-primitive` | "the leaf inputs match", computed via `inputKey` | "is this body a call to that one?": the Noul the old judge already ran, over a resolved graph |
| `object-shape` | suppressed when keys are a subset of any declared type | "is this shape a declared type or an unnamed one?" |
| `policy.ask.minTokens` / `maxCandidates` | a keyword filter standing in for relevance | `ask` already does this with Nouls per candidate |

`EDGE_ROLES`, `moduleRoles`, `dutyVocabulary` and `homeVocabulary` are already
this: they are options handed to a `Decision`, which is the right shape and
should be the template for the rest.

## Regime 2: no classifier, the switch IS the answer

A specification executed: a lookup table, a grammar, a dispatcher, pushed-down
agreement. The branches are the product. Collapsing these into a fuzzy
classifier does not make the tool better; it makes it **wrong** -- a probability
distribution over options where the caller needs an execution.

joggle's own Regime 2 set, which is the whole deterministic half:

- `imports.ts` -- resolving a specifier to a file is a lookup, not a judgement.
- `architecture.ts` / `import-architecture.ts` -- `cyclesIn`, `directionViolations`,
  `purityViolations`. A cycle is a property of the graph. There is no "probably".
- `cascade.ts` -- the import-graph walk that lists what a merge costs. A fact.
- `operation.ts` `permitted` / `settle` -- the part that is a rule, not a vote.
- `workspace.ts` parsing and normalisation -- the index everything else reads.
- test files, migrations, config -- a classifier that has to be run per run is
  the wrong tool for code where the answer is fixed.

The previous implementation was mostly Regime 1 with more constants: a
hand-written heuristics binary, every threshold tunable, and no calibration
harness. That is the pile this layer exists to replace -- and the mistake to
avoid is replacing Regime 2 with it instead.

## The test

For every branch, ask: **is the classification about meaning, or about a fact
that can be decided from the graph?**

- If a person would tune the threshold, or argue about a borderline case, it is
  Regime 1. Delete the branch; supply the evidence; ask a `Choice`, `Score` or
  `Noul`; put the code back in charge of the *consequences* of the answer.
- If a wrong answer is a wrong answer -- a cycle that is not a cycle, a specifier
  that resolves to the wrong file -- it is Regime 2. Keep it, and make it
  provable.

The `roleRank` case is the sharpest: a rank is being treated as derivation
("lower cannot import higher"), but the ranks are a taste about what "domain"
means. It should be a question, and the import-direction rule should read the
answer. That is the first candidate.

## The second question: are we feeding state, or doing the classification?

This is the one that matters for the judged rules, and the honest answer is
**one is doing the work and the other is supplying state**.

### Doing the work ahead of time

`derivedOperation` in `operation.ts` computes `merge` from
`oneThing >= probabilityFloor` and `difference === "value"`, then `settle`
cross-checks it against the model's own read. The cross-check is good design --
diverse estimators, disagreement reported -- but it only exists because the
table is doing the work first. The `difference` question already tells the model
what to decide; asking it about the operation TOO is the code second-guessing
the answer it paid for.

The cleaner shape: ask `difference` (which the model can answer), and let the
table and the model's `operation` answer be *peers* rather than one deriving the
other.

### Supplying state

`cluster-verdict.ts` is the model to copy. One cluster, one request, and the
panel is the material a reviewer would need: each declaration's `source`,
`documented`, `doc`, `types`, and -- when the run asked for a trace -- the
compiler's `resolved`. The questions point into it by backticked path, which is
what the TypeSafe docs ask for. `read` decides consequences from the answers and
does not re-ask them.

The type layer is the same move one level deeper: `resolved.display` is a
compiler fact in the state, not a judgement the code made. See
`docs/type-resolution.md`.

### Where the split puts the last round

- `reimplemented-primitive` keying on `inputKey` is the code doing the work.
  The right fix is upstream: a *resolved call graph* is the state, and the
  resurrection is a question asked once over it -- the same Noul the deleted
  `same_behavior` used, but with call sites in the state, which is what that
  question was missing.
- `object-shape` and `field-type-drift` are in the same place: pure Regime 1
  wearing a Regime 2 costume. Deterministic and free, so they stay as a cheap
  first pass; their over-reported cases are the judgement, not the rule.

## What to do next

All four are done.

1. **`roleRank` is a question.** `RoleRanking` in `vocabulary.ts` asks which role
   sits lowest; `classifyModules` asks it once per run and returns `ranks`, and
   `module-direction` reads them. `EDGE_ROLES` followed: `edgeRolesOf(ranks)`
   derives the outer layer, so a repository whose API is the edge and whose UI is
   the product is no longer reported upside down.
2. **`prescriptionFor` is an option set.** The prescription is one more
   `Decision.classify` on the cluster questionnaire, with the operations the
   import graph permits named in the instructions. The table remains only for the
   unverified path and its tests.
3. **`derivedOperation` and the model are peers.** `settle` compares them and
   reports a disagreement; neither decides first.
4. **Resurrection is judged.** `reimplemented-primitive` became a `PlannedRule`:
   the call graph generates pairs (high recall), and a question over both graphs
   decides whether they are the same operation. `inputKey` is now evidence in the
   state rather than the verdict.

## What this cost

`reimplemented-primitive` moved from the deterministic column to the judged one,
so a run with no model key now reports its pairs marked unverified instead of
asserting them. The breach count in `check.test.ts` went 11 -> 10 for the same
reason: a rule that asks a question is withheld when its evidence would cross a
repository boundary.
